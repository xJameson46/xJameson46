Hi, I'm xJameson46.

I've successfully created 2 sniperbots that snipes the newest Futures listing on ByBit & MEXC. (Includes MEXC api "under maintenance" solution).

Ideally, I want both of these codes private, but due to personal circumstances, I'm willing to share to maybe 1 other person who would keep it private as well.

I really just need urgent funds.

That's all. I've posted photos and videos on how they work. Willing to hop on a call to showcase more if interested.
